Installation dependencies
=========================

The internals of Biff are implemented in C and Cython. To build the Cython code, you'll need to
have installed [GNU scientific library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). On a Mac, I
recommend installing this with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or [anaconda](http://anaconda.org). With
anaconda, you can install GSL with:

    conda -c https://anaconda.org/asmeurer/gsl install gsl

You'll also need the following packages:

    - [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython)
    - [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
    - [Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
    - [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy)
    - [Gala](https://github.com/adrn/gala) (install with `pip install astro-gala`)
